### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to my Git Hub page, and yes... I'm a developer too.

##### I'm a software developer since 2013, focused on back-end development with PHP, Node.js and Java. Founder of a company named Power Push - Powering Ideias and creator of the Powerframe Framework, a framework designed to help all the PHP developers to create simple and yet scalable REST API's for (but not only) Docker environments. Also a great fan of tecnologies like Vue Js, Angular and React on the front-end development.
